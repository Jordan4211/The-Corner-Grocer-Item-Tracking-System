# The-Corner-Grocer-Item-Tracking-System

## Project Summary

The Corner Grocer Item Tracking System helps arrange fruits and vegetables better by looking at how often they're bought. It takes data from a text file, figures out the buying patterns, and uses this info to help with store layout. It's a hands-on way to see how data handling and user interaction using C++.

## Strengths

This project showcases how it uses `std::map` to keep track of item frequencies smoothly, showing off a solid grasp of C++ libraries. It also has a friendly interface that lets users look up how often items are bought, see all item counts, or check out a frequency histogram, which proves skill in making applications that interact with users.

## Areas for Improvement

It could be better by adding more advanced data analysis, like spotting trends or giving inventory advice. These changes would not only make the program run smoother but also give more useful insights for business.

## Challenges

A big hurdle was dealing with item names that are spelled differently but mean the same thing, and making sure the count for each item was right. This was fixed by making all item names lowercase, which made the rest of the coding process a lot easier.

## Tools and Resources

Help from StackOverflow was very important for me in solving specific issues, like fixing input errors and understanding how to treat all item names the same way. These have become important tools.

## Transferable Skills

The project helped develop skills in working with files, processing data, and creating user-friendly interfaces, which are useful for many other projects. Handling real data and meeting user needs in this project is great practice for future challenges.

## Maintainability and Adaptability

The project is easy to keep up and modify thanks to separating tasks into different classes and methods, and clear explanations. Following good practices with header and CPP files makes it easier to update or change the program later. This was the main reason for separating them.
